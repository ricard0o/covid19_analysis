As a result of the covid-19 pandemic, the U.S economy took a huge hit. In this analysis, I take a look at some aspects of the economy to see how the pandemic affected it. 

This analysis is not meant to be a comprehensive analysis of every aspect of the economy. It merely looks at some indicators which I believe tell the story of how the pandemic took the world by storm. 

Most of the data used in this analysis was obtained from kaggle. Data cleaning was mostly done with the help of openrefine. 

There is much more I could have done with this analysis. This analysis merely scratches the surface of all the information out there in regards to the impact of the pandemic.
